# HELP AND DISPLAY MESSAGES
HELP:
  help: |
    All possible input commands are:
    - cd: Changes the current directory. For more information about change, please use 'help cd'.
    - folder: Sorts the current directory files in folders. For more information about folder, please use 'help folder'.
    - trash: Trashes the useless videos. For more information about trash, please use 'help trash'.
    - date: Sorts the current directory files in folders by date. For more information about date, please use 'help date'.
    - help: Brings out various help message, including this one.
    - exit: Leaves this tool. If your are using a keyboard you can also use EOF shortcut (Ctrl + D on Linux for instance).
    The usual way to use the tool is to type the following successive instructions:
    '>> cd foo'
    '>> folder'
    '>> cd Videos'
    '>> trash 3'
    '>> date'
    but you can do what you want!
  exit: |
    The 'exit' command leaves this tool. If your are using a keyboard you can also use EOF shortcut (Ctrl + D on Linux for instance).
  cd: |
    The 'cd' command changes the current directory. The syntax to change directory is:
    '>> cd <directory>'
  folder: |
    The 'folder' command sorts the files in the current directory by type. The syntax to use the command is:
    '>> folder'

    The repositories and the extensions they will contain are:
  folder-creation: >
    If they do not already exist and if a file of a corresponding extension is found in the current directory, these directories will be created and then filled.
  trash: |
    The 'trash' command puts the videos of the current directory that are too short in a 'Trash' directory. The syntax to use the command is,
    '>> trash <time_limit>'
    where time_limit is the video length threshold.
  date: |
    The 'date' command sorts the files in the current directory by creation date. The syntax to use the command is:
    '>> date'
    The folders will be in the form of 'YYMMDD-Day'.
  rename: |
    The 'rename' command opens and lets you rename the files in the current directory. The folders aren't examined. The syntax to use the command is:
    '>> rename $directory'
    where $directory is the type of files you want to rename. If $directory is not specified, all files are going to be examined.
  sudo: |
    If these python scripts are moved by the tool, bad things may happen. Therefore by default, the tool checks if the current directory contains the 'video-logging' folder in its arborescence by looking for the '.videolog' file. This process is usually quite fast but it may take a while when dealing with big directories. The 'sudo' command allows to deactivate this checking, increasing the speed of the tool:
    '>> sudo on'
    Use at your on risks. To deactivate sudo mode, simply run
    '>> sudo off'
  help-twice:
    Why are you here?
  other: >
    The command couldn't be parsed. Try typing 'help' to see the possible input commands.
WARNINGS:
  syntax-dir: |
    The syntax to change directory is:
    '>> cd <directory>'
  syntax-time: |
    The syntax to choose the time limit is:
    '>> trash <time limit>'
  syntax-sudo: |
    The syntax to change sudo mode is:
    '>> sudo off'
  sudo-on: |
    ! Warning: sudo mode activated. The tool will not check if the current directory contains the 'video-logging' scripts anymore.
    ! Moving files may do bad things.
    ! You can turn the sudo mode back off using:
    '>> sudo off'
  sudo-off:
    sudo mode deactivated.
  sudo-exception: |
    ! Warning: the current directory contains the 'video-logging' scripts.
    ! Moving files may do bad things.
    ! Please move the 'video-logging' folder somewhere else then navigate to the folder you want to sort using the 'cd' command.
